“For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away.”

The Matthew effect show the phenomenon where "the rich get richer and the poor get poorer". Knowledge is the same, the more you learn the more you know. Life is all about learning; when the time you stop learning, the time you die.

Life is what you created to the world.

Keeps your brain young and creative depending on what you are learning. There is something about holding new knowledge that makes my mind happy. 

keep learning and make life more possible.

This project is a learning log respository of my daily work. It's recorded by day.
