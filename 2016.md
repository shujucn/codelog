It's the first day after National Day holidays. I need do somthing to get more info of Swift, It's been a long time since swift 3.0 release.

  	####Initialization:
	◦	init(frame:) - It is recommended that you implement this method. You can 		also implement custom initialization methods in addition to, or instead of, 		this method. 
	◦	init(coder:) - Implement this method if you load your view from an Interface 		Builder nib file and your view requires custom initialization. 
	◦	layerClass Use this property only if you want your view to use a different 		Core Animation layer for its backing store. For example, if your view uses 		tiling to display a large scrollable area, you might want to set the 		property 	to the CATiledLayer class. 
	•	Drawing and printing:
	◦	draw(_:) - Implement this method if your view draws custom content. If your 		view does not do any custom drawing, avoid overriding this method. 
	◦	draw(_:for:) - Implement this method only if you want to draw your view’s 		content differently during printing. 
	####Constraints:
	◦	requiresConstraintBasedLayout Use this property if your view class requires 		constraints to work properly. 
	◦	updateConstraints() - Implement this method if your view needs to create 		custom constraints between your subviews. 
	◦	alignmentRect(forFrame:), frame(forAlignmentRect:) - Implement these methods 		to override how your views are aligned to other views. 
	####Layout:
	◦	sizeThatFits(_:) - Implement this method if you want your view to have a 		different default size than it normally would during resizing operations. 		For example, you might use this method to prevent your view from shrinking 		to the point where subviews cannot be displayed correctly. 
	◦	layoutSubviews() - Implement this method if you need more precise control 		over the layout of your subviews than either the constraint or autoresizing 		behaviors provide. 
	◦	didAddSubview(_:), willRemoveSubview(_:) - Implement these methods as needed 		to track the additions and removals of subviews. 
	◦	willMove(toSuperview:), didMoveToSuperview() - Implement these methods as 		needed to track the movement of the current view in your view hierarchy. 
	◦	willMove(toWindow:), didMoveToWindow() - Implement these methods as needed 		to track the movement of your view to a different window. 
	•	Event Handling:
	◦	touchesBegan(_:with:), touchesMoved(_:with:), 		touchesEnded(_:with:),touchesCancelled(_:with:) - Implement these methods if 		you need to handle touch events directly. (For gesture-based input, use 		gesture recognizers.) 
	◦	gestureRecognizerShouldBegin(_:) - Implement this method if your view 		handles touch events directly and might want to prevent attached gesture 		recognizers from triggering additional actions.
